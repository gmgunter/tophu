class TiledPartition:
    """
    A partitioning of an N-dimensional array into tiles.

    A `TiledPartition` object subdivides an array of given shape into one or more
    roughly equally sized, possibly overlapping, tiles. Each tile corresponds to a block
    of data from the original array (or another array of similar shape). The full set of
    tiles spans the array.

    A tile is represented by an index expression (i.e. a tuple of `slice` objects) that
    can be used to access the corresponding block of data from the partitioned array.
    Individual tiles can be accessed using the subscripting operator. In addition,
    `TiledPartition` objects support iterating over the set of tiles in arbitrary order.
